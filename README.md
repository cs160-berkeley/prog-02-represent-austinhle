# PROG 02: Represent!

This application allows users to view the senators and representatives for a specific zip code or location, or uses their current location to show them who is representing them in the government. It also provides a quick view from the watch that allows users to view additional details (such as end of term date, committees they are on, and recent bills they have sponsored) if they wish to. In addition, the watch also supports a view that shows the results of the 2012 presidential vote for the associated county.
